This is an abstract on how to use the application.

The LSTM file is merely a python notebook containing the required graphs and other instruments used during data analysis to predict 
the human traffic on a particular route, so that the government can send buses on those routes accordingly

This app includes a QR scanner , which one would be required to be used , once aboard the bus. There will be QR codes behind the
seats. Upon scanning the user's data would be sent via server to the government to store. This increases security as if crimes happen 
on a particular bus with these provisions,the names of all the suspects will be present.

One needs to register using their AADHAR CARD and email id. Once registered the customer is available to the benefits of coupons and other 
things which would be provided if a person is a regular customer.
